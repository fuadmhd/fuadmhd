## About Me

I began coding in 2019 while pursuing a degree in Computer Science. During college, I also took on freelance work, which helped me gain real-world experience early on. I initially explored native development, but later transitioned to building web applications using TypeScript, React, and Next.js over the past two years. Since then, Iâ€™ve focused on developing internal tools , web apps that are data-heavy, include authentication and user role management, and often integrate AI-powered features.
